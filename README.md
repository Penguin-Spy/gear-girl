The [Gear Girl character mod by SleepyEngi](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/GirlCharacter), updated to Factorio 2.0. High resolution renders from [machinesmith42](https://github.com/machinesmith42/GirlCharacter_1.0.6) (sprites were repacked to reduce blank space in textures). Uses [!skins](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/skins-factored) for maximum compatibility.
